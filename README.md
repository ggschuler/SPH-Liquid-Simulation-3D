# Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Simulation

This application is an implementation of the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics model for simulating fluids. It was developed as a final project to the Computer Animation graduate course in Computer Science (PUCRS). It runs on Unity, the whole simulation is made with C# and runs on the CPU. For further detail, check the following [report](https://github.com/ggschuler/Smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics-sim/blob/main/Smoothed_Particle_Hydrodynamics_Solver_for_Fluid_Simulations.pdf).

Besides references detailed on the report, three blog posts were used for implementing the SPH solver:
